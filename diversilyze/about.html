<h3 class="about">Why?</h3>
<p class="analyze-desc about">
Black on white: women are underrepresented in most areas in society. The music industry is not an exception. According to a research by the organization Jämställd Festival (Equal festival), 73% of the Swedish festival acts are of male gender. In Europe, the numbers are even more unequal: 91% of the artists are men.</p>
<p class="analyze-desc about">
And why is this? There’s definitely not a lack of women playing music. In music school, xx xx FIND STATISTICS FOR THIS</p>
<p class="analyze-desc about">
For some reason, women disappear somewhere along the road and don’t manage to reach out in the same way – perhaps they’re seen as less competent. This means that we’re probably missing out on lots of good music, only because of the structures we have in society today.</p>
<p class="analyze-desc about">
This, we want to change.</p>


<h3 class="about">How?</h3>
<p class="analyze-desc about">We want to create awareness of how unequal the music industry is today by putting it black on white how the gender balance looks in your and your friends’ playlists.</p>
<p class="analyze-desc about">
Moreover, as festivals often create playlists of their lineups, we have the opportunity to put pressure on those to reach an equal gender balance. Having an equal lineup and being able to share this on social media is a great selling argument for festivals.</p>



<h3 class="about">What?</h3>
<p class="analyze-desc about">To do this, we introduce Equalyze – a web app that analyzes your Spotify playlists based on the artists’ gender. Equalyze lets you see the gender balance in your playlists, and gives you suggestions on artists to even out the balance if it’s not equal.</p>
<p class="analyze-desc about">
Of course you can share your results on Facebook, as well as browsing other people’s results.</p>
